# SecureVoting

## The problem
Elections are the foundation of the democratic expression of a free people. Nowadays, despite enormous technological progress, the process is still done by paper. Despite all the security guarantees, it is run by the state and for this reason there has been much controversy and the veracity of the elections themselves has been questioned many times.

## The idea
The idea was therefore to exploit existing technologies to create a secure voting mechanism that was not managed by any authority (decentralised) and that could guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the vote cast. The technology that is able to guarantee these properties is the Blockchain.

## The implementation
SecureVoting was created with the idea of implementing a secure voting system based on the Ethereum blockchain.
Several technologies were used for the implementation, including:
1. Ganache
2. Truffle
3. Metamask
4. Solidity
5. Web3.js
